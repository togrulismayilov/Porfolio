      <p>
        Hello! I'm Toğrul, I'm 15 years old, and I've been focusing on front-end
        development for the past 7.5 months. With my passion for web
        development, I've honed my skills in technologies like HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Currently, I'm building dynamic web applications using
        modern libraries like React.js. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and
        self-improvement, aiming to contribute to larger projects in the future.
